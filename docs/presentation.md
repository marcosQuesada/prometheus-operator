### Tips for the presentation
While we donâ€™t want to force a certain structure to your presentation, we have had good experiences with the following running order:
- Short introduction about you as a person (~5m)
- Recap of the task (~5m)
- Talk about the questions above (~5m)
- Demo (~5m)
    - Protip: Start the demo when you start giving the presentation, or have a backup video at hand
    - Show us your design, architecture, and some code (~10m)
- Technical discussion / questions from the audience
    - You should have questions for the audience!
- Free discussion
